# About

Currently PokéGen is a WIP clicker/idle/incremental game that's in development. It's built in vanilla JavaScript and using [Inferno](https://www.infernojs.org/).

The project is open source, and you are also able to check out the project at any point here:
- [Github repository](https://github.com/Ephenia/PokeGen)
- [Live deployment of the game](https://ephenia.github.io/PokeGen/)

If you would like to help out, then you are free to submit bugs that you find [by opening an issue](https://github.com/Ephenia/PokeGen/issues). Or if you have any other ideas of your own that you'd like to pitch, then I would love to read and potentially consider them!

## What this game plans to offer and feature:
- Being able to gain and create energy (essentially what will be the main currency of the game)
- Be able to use that energy and do things with it (such as creating other items, and things like Pokémon too!)
- Be able to collect Pokémon and also shiny hunt them
- The unique idea and concept of being able to convert one Pokémon to another!
***(and more details soon to come...!)***

The main inspiration behind my idea for this game is actually based off of a Minecraft mod called [ProjectE](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/projecte). I really loved the core idea of this mod and had found it really fun to play around with when it came to bigger mudpack like a [ATM9 Sky](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-9-to-the-sky) that I've had a playthrough of recently.

I thought it would be really cool to actually turn the core idea and concept of ProjectE and try to apply that to Pokémon in some way and build off of that idea, and that's really where my motivation behind this project mainly lies at. I just thought that it would be a really fun and unique idea that's fresh. It's also in a way reminiscent of [PokeGen](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/1620-pokegen/) which was essentially [PKHeX](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/1-pkhex/) but for earlier generations of Pokémon games.
